# Day 50 of python with programming pagluðŸŽ€

# I completed the 50th day of the 100 days of python challenge.


# Learning Python GUIs with Tkinter + SQLite â€“ My Experience

# After 50 days of coding Python daily, I finally dove into the world of **GUI applications** â€” and itâ€™s been a game-changer!

## ðŸ“† What I Built

# - Day 45: My first Tkinter window (felt like magic!)
# - Day 46: A functional calculator (Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide)
# - Day 47: To-Do app with Add/Delete buttons
# - Day 48: Connected GUI with SQLite â€“ now tasks get saved!
# - Day 49: A full-fledged Task Tracker App (GUI + DB)

## ðŸ§  What I Learned

# - Tkinter widgets like `Entry`, `Button`, `Label`, `Frame`, and `Listbox`
# - Layout systems like `.pack()` and `.grid()`
# - Handling user input and binding actions (like clicking a button)
# - Connecting a GUI with **SQLite** to save data
# - Performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations

## âš¡ Wins

# - My first real app that stores and shows tasks using a database
# - Learned to build logic and UI at the same time
# - Built multiple working tools I can actually use

## ðŸ§© Challenges

# - Positioning widgets correctly took time (pack vs grid confusion!)
# - Dealing with SQLite errors while inserting/updating data
# - Refreshing data in the UI after a database operation

## ðŸ™Œ Takeaway

# Python GUI programming with Tkinter felt like **bringing my apps to life**. Seeing a button click update a database was such a cool moment.

# Next, Iâ€™m planning to explore:
# - ðŸ”¥ Flask for Web Apps
# - ðŸŽ® PyGame for interactive games

# Thanks for reading!
